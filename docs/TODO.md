# Longhair Records — Ecommerce Site

## Task List

- [x] Adjust servers PHP config to better handle large requests to make inventory adjustments and other bulk operations.
  - [x] Run through delete process again to test if these changes have any effect on performance.
- [x] Deploy child theme updates and custom square plugin updates.
- [x] Configure the Square plugin (Woo → Settings → Square):
  - [x] System of Record = Square
  - [x] Match by SKU = ON
  - [x] Update existing products = Enabled
  - [x] Sync direction = Square → Woo only (at least for this first full import)
  - [x] If your version has it: Batch size / Throttle = 50–100 items per request
- [x] Pilot import
  - [x] Run a manual sync for a small batch (e.g. 500 items).
  - [x] Check Woo → Products → make sure:
    - [x] Only one copy per SKU.
    - [x] Images imported.
    - [x] Stock values match Square.
  - [x] Check Woo → Status → Logs → square-…log:
    - [x] Should be 1 log file only for the run.
    - [x] Should not show SKU already exists.
- [x] If the pilot is successful, do a full import:
  - [x] Run sync on the full catalog.
  - [x] Monitor logs — you should see a single continuous square-… log growing large, not 10–15 new ones starting every few minutes.
- [x] Post-import checks
  - [x] Spot check 10–20 random items: SKU, stock, price, and image all match Square.
  - [x] Confirm no duplicates in Woo.
  - [x] Keep an eye on logs for a few days — you want to see one log per scheduled sync, not dozens.
- [ ] Fix WooCommerce templates in current theme.
- [ ] Add template customizations to child theme via hooks in the child theme’s `functions.php` file to avoid having to update the template files in the parent theme when there are updates to the WooCommerce plugin.
- [x] Get email sending functioning again on site for new orders, confirmation emails, etc.
  - [x] Need to verify we have a valid AWS account with SES enabled.
  - [x] Need to configure the WP Offload SES plugin with AWS credentials.
  - [x] Send test emails from Offload SES plugin.
- [ ] Get the business email addresses/service on the Gmail interface.
- [x] Verify Cloudflare DNS is working correctly.
- [ ] Compile a list of what services are being provided by GoDaddy and BlueHost
- [ ] Get a remote environment set up for sandboxing ecommerce solutions.
- [x] Remove Spotify/Soundcloud links
- [ ] Root out any payment gremlins that may be lurking around.
- [ ] Set up Stripe as a backup payment processor.
  - [ ] Square and Stripe can work together, but not directly; they can be connected through third-party integration services like Zapier, Skyvia, and Albato to automate data synchronization and workflows between the two platforms.
  - [ ] Test Stripe integration.
- [ ] Figure out how to get Smart Manager to save searches.
- [x] Merge custom integration code into new version of Square plugin.
- [x] Get HTTPS working properly on site.
- [x] Fix broken categories box on frontend. Curerntly not showing "Records" or "7-Inch" categories.
