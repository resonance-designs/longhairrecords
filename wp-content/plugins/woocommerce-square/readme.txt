Securely accept payments, synchronize sales, and seamlessly manage inventory and product data between WooCommerce and Square POS.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to securely accept payments, synchronize sales, and seamlessly manage inventory and product data between WooCommerce and Square POS.

The Square plugin is PCI and SAQ A-level compliant.

= Accept payments anywhere, anytime =

- The Square plugin extends WooCommerce to allow you to accept payments via Square - including support for [Apple Pay®](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/), [Google Pay](https://www.google.com/payments/solutions/), [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) and [WooCommerce Pre-Orders](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-pre-orders/).
- Recurring customers can save payment methods and use them at checkout.
- Customize payment forms with automatic formatting, mobile-friendly options, and retina card icons.

= Manage your business all in one place =

Sync your product and inventory information from WooCommerce to Square, or from Square to WooCommerce — set everything up once, and whenever you make a sale, your inventory automatically updates on both platforms.

- If you sell mainly online, set WooCommerce as your system of record so WooCommerce pushes product name, inventory, prices, categories, and images to Square.
- If you sell in multiple locations and online, set Square as your system of record so Square pushes product name, inventory, prices, categories, and images to WooCommerce.

== Installation ==

You can download an [older version of this gateway for older versions of WooCommerce from here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-square/developers/).

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To
automatically install WooCommerce Square, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click **Add New**.

In the search field type "WooCommerce Square" and click **Search Plugins**. Once you've found our plugin you can install it by clicking **Install Now**, as well as view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

= Note =
If running PHP 8.2+, you may see some deprecation notices being logged. These notices are known and do not impact any plugin functionality.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this require an SSL certificate? =

Yes! An SSL certificate must be installed on your site to use Square.

= Where can I find documentation? =

For help setting up and configuring the plugin, please refer to our [user guide](https://woo.com/document/woocommerce-square/).

= Where can I get support or talk to other users? =

If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the [Plugin Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-square/).
