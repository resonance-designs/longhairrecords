# Page Updates For New Styling

1. Apply lh-store-layout class to all Divi product category pages:

* [x] Store - Sizing is slightly off, but it's close enough for now.
* [x] Single Product - Model everything else on the design of this page: https://longhairrecords.com/product/super-mario-bros-1993-jankel-morton-1993-japanese-import-clam-eng-lang-w-japanese-subs-vhs2023-6-4-38/
